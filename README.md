## Questions

Spotify uses the metric of *valence* which corresponds to how happy a track is. This metric was not developed by Spotify itself. It was originally developed by Echo Nest, a company acquired by Spotify in 2014. We don't know exactly how the valence of each track is calculated. There are some details in a blog post that can be found here:

The goal is to be able to figure out a way to calculate the valence of a track. To do this you will need to use Spotify's programming interface (Spotify API), following the instructions here: https://developer.spotify.com/. You can use the following two calls to the interface to gather the data to process:

* [Get Track's Audio Features](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-audio-features) and [Get Tracks' Audio Features](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-several-audio-features).

* Optionally, [Get Track's Audio Analysis](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-audio-analysis).

As a basis you will use the data for tracks that have been in the top listening positions in various countries, which can be found here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4778562 and in the `charts.zip` file.

### Q1: Valence prediction without Neural Networks

Use Machine Learning techniques of your choice, but outside of neural networks, to best predict the valence of the pieces.

* You will use at least three different methods. For each method, look for the best model with the best possible hyperparameter values.

* Once you have found the best model, explain, as far as possible, which characteristics affect the vigor of a track.

* After finding the best model, use it to calculate the valence of the tracks given in the `spotify_ids.txt` file. As a metric you should use the Mean Average Error.


### Q2: Predicting Validity with Neural Networks

Now you will try to make the best model using neural networks.

* You are free to use any neural network architecture you want. Watch out for overfitting.

* After you have found the best model, you will use it to calculate the valence of the pieces given in the `spotify_ids.txt` file. As a metric you should use the Mean Average Error.

Finally, which was the best approach, with or without neural networks?
